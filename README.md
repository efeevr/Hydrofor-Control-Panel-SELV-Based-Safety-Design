# Hydrofor-Control-Panel-SELV-Based-Safety-Design
This project documents a simple hydrofor (booster pump) control panel designed to prevent dry running when the water level in the storage tank drops below a critical threshold. The system was intentionally designed using SELV (Safety Extra-Low Voltage) principles to reduce electrical shock risk in wet environments.
